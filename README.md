# SemanticInformationRetrieval (SIR)
A comprehensive, modularized information retrieval system for knowledge management solution providers.

This is a workspace repository for the upcoming [Workshop - Taking the first step towards a Semantic Information Retrieval System (SIRS)](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/SMWCon_Fall_2017/Workshop_- Taking_the_first_step_towards_a_Semantic_Information_Retrieval_System (SIRS)) at [SMWCon Fall 2017](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/SMWCon_Fall_2017).

All current files are extracted from [smw-cindykate.com](https://smw-cindykate.com)'s extension providing [Community:Search](https://smw-cindykate.com/main/Community:Search). As such, they merely serve as a starting point and do not form a working extension.
